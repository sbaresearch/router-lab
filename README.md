# Router Lab

This repository outlines a small infrastructure plus code to test the responsiveness of available router images for various vendors.

* src: The code to conduct the measurements
* config: Config files for the measurement script to specify which routers under test are used.
* networkDiagram: A small diagram to visualize the test scenario within GNS3.
* router_start_config: The starting config which is used to enable and disable test scenarios for each testcase within the script.

This repository does *not* include any images for the used routers.
