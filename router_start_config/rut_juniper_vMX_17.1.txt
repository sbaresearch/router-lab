# Config Changes based on default config

## Pre Config
The juniper vMX consists of two seperate entities, one for the actual forwarding (vFP), the second for controlling (vCP).
The two routers need to be connected as per manual. All configuration needs to be done on the controlling plane.
Enter configuration mode by entering 'cli' in the command line to start the juniper cli.
